# Ninjarc
Super minimal .rc files for traipsing around Other People's Serversâ„¢

# Why?

Get In And Get Out of some random server with color and comfort. Zero dependencies to install. No plugins. The only external tool used is [fuzzy-finder](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/). This is an experiment in minimalism.

# Installation
```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config && git clone https://github.com/turnspike/ninjarc.git ~/.config/ninjarc && chmod u+x ~/.config/ninjarc/install.sh && ~/.config/ninjarc/install.sh
```

Ninjarc will skip existing files by default. To force overwrite, run install.sh with the -f param:
```sh
~/ninjarc/install.sh -f
```

TODO: add option to skip installation of Vim settings.

# Known bugs

* On MacOS, horizontal rules don't fit to new screen width when terminal is resized (tput cols is returning wrong value)
* On RHEL, install.sh -f won't force overwrite; workaround is to rm the relevant .rc files in ~ first
* Old versions of RHEL might not have go, so FZF will be unavailable
