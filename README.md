# Ninjarc
Super minimal .rc files for traipsing around Other People's Serversâ„¢

# Why?

Get In And Get Out of some random server with color and comfort. Zero dependencies to install. No plugins.

This is an experiment in minimalism as a response to my previous [https://github.com/turnspike/aetherwolf](plugin-heavy, super customized workflow). The only external tool used is [https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/](fuzzy-finder), which is portable.

Another goal is to minimise friction when using Vim mode in various IDEs such as [http://spacemacs.org](Spacemacs) and [https://atom.io](Atom), which don't necessarily have particular Vim plugins available.

# Philosophy

Yes:
- Speed
- Simplicity
- Small problem space, easy to hold in mind

Minimal:
- Shortcuts to remember
- Helper functions

No:
- Dependencies to install
- Plugins
- Leader keys

# Installation
````
git clone https://github.com/turnspike/ninjarc.git ~/ninjarc && chmod u+x ~/ninjarc/install.sh && ~/ninjarc/install.sh
````

Ninjarc will skip existing files by default. To force overwrite, run install.sh with the -f param:
````
~/ninjarc/install.sh -f
````

# User Settings

You'll probably want to add your own user settings eg git username. Just 
````
cp -f ~/ninjarc/*.user ~
````

---

# Vim notes

No plugins, mimimal config.
