# Ninjarc
Super minimal .rc files for traipsing around Other People's Serversâ„¢

# Why?

Get In And Get Out of some random server with color and comfort. Zero dependencies to install. No plugins. The only external tool used is [fuzzy-finder](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/), which is portable.

This is an experiment in minimalism as a response to my previous [plugin-heavy, super customized workflow](https://github.com/turnspike/aetherwolf). Using every plugin under the sun was like unto a tacticool mallninja. Another goal is to minimise friction when using Vim mode in various IDEs such as [Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org) and [Atom](https://atom.io), which don't necessarily have particular Vim plugins available. 

# Philosophy

**Yes:**
- Speed
- Simplicity
- Small problem space, easy to hold in mind

**Minimal:**
- Shortcuts to remember
- Helper functions

**No:**
- Dependencies to install
- Plugins
- Leader keys

# Installation
````
git clone https://github.com/turnspike/ninjarc.git ~/ninjarc && chmod u+x ~/ninjarc/install.sh && ~/ninjarc/install.sh
````

Ninjarc will skip existing files by default. To force overwrite, run install.sh with the -f param:
````
~/ninjarc/install.sh -f
````

---

# User Settings

You might want to add your own user settings eg git username. Just:
````
cp -f ~/ninjarc/*.user ~
````

Then edit to taste. This step can usually be ignored for ops work on random servers.

# Vim notes
